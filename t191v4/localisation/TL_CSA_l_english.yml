csa.1.desc:0 "Confederate troops now stand on the shores of the Great Lakes, the push through the middle of the United States has split their nation in two. Now, the United States has no hope of resisting the might of the Confederate army, the industrial centers in the east cannot receive the raw materials from the west. There has been talk about offering the Yankees a negotiated peace where our lands will be returned, reparations will be paid, and their border will be demilitarized. Shall we offer this peace or shall we crush the Northern menace once and for all?"
csa.1.a:0 "We have achieved our goals."
csa.1.b:0 "No peace without total victory."

Furthermore, their border states will be demilitarized and they will repay the Great War reparations that they unjustly took from us."
