news.1.t:0 "The USA Rejects Confederate Peace Offer"
news.1.d:0 "The Confederates, having scored a decisive victory against the United States with their successful armored advance to the Great Lakes, have offered a peace deal ending the war where they would regain the territories lost in the Great War, be paid war reparations equal to the amount they paid after the Great War, and force the US to demilitarize their border with the CSA. The USA has rejected their demands out of hand, saying "We have lost a battle, we have not lost the war." American industry and ingenuity will be put to the test as the war continues, suffering from the loss of a reliable transcontinental supply line. The rejection of Confederate demands only cements future demands for unconditional surrender. Both nations are sure to mobilize to their full extent as they struggle to achieve final victory in this bloody conflict."
