tlusa.1.desc:0 "Hoover has been president since the previous election in 1932 when he ousted President Blackford, a member of the Socialist Party. Returning the country back to Democratic rule, Hoover has pursued a laissez-faire policy of nonintervention into the economy while the Great Depression grinds on. Many Americans blame him for the current ill's afflicting the country. Now the question is, will the Socialist Party reclaim the presidency with Al Smith or will Hoover somehow ride out his unpopularity and eke out an electoral victory?"
