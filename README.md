# Timeline-191
Hearts of Iron IV mod based off of Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory series

Alright, so the mod is accessed through the .mod file. I personally click the Timeline-191 folder to examine the t191v5 folder and download that.
However the alternative method is to move all the t191v5 files out into the Timeline-191 folder, delete the t191v5 folder, and change the .mod file path from t191v5 to Timeline-191
